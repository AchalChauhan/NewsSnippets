# NewsSnippets

NewsSnippets is a News Feed website that will feature the latest news for select topics, from Flipboard.

I have build NewsSnippets using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
Utilized the figma file to understand the design requirements
Used Accordions and Image Carousel to improve UI
Fetched news content from flipboard's RSS feed using REST API
Deployed the website to Netlify/Vercel
